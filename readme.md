# lilvim

> a lil, modular config

## Features

- ðŸª´ Self-contained modules
- ðŸ“¦ Prioritised built-in functionality
- ðŸ¥Ÿ Deliciously simple to extend

## Usage

```sh
# Notice the destination folder is lilvim, not nvim
git clone https://github.com/mvllow/lilvim ~/.config/lilvim

## Principles

> Heavily inspired by [Rational Emacs](https://github.com/SystemCrafters/rational-emacs)

### Minimal and modular by design

Lilvim includes several self-contained modules which handle their own vim options, keymaps and configurations. This approach differs from the common practice of separating functionality by plugin.

### Prioritise built-in Neovim functionality

We demonstrate Neovim's built-in capabilities and lower the platform's barrier to entry for new users. This lightweight approach encourages users to first understand the platform's features before adding plugins.
