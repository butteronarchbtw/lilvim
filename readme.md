# lilvim

> a lil, modular config

## Features

- ðŸª´ Self-contained modules
- ðŸ“¦ Prioritised built-in functionality
- ðŸ¥Ÿ Deliciously simple to extend

## Usage

```sh
# Notice the destination folder is lilvim, not nvim
git clone https://github.com/mvllow/lilvim ~/.config/lilvim

# Run lilvim by setting the NVIM_APPNAME environment variable
NVIM_APPNAME=lilvim nvim
```

Alternatively, you may pull any module into your own config.

## Principles

> Heavily inspired by [Rational Emacs](https://github.com/SystemCrafters/rational-emacs)

### Minimal and modular by design

This project includes several self-contained modules which handle their own vim options, keymaps and configurations, contrary to another popular approach of isolating those three categories.

### Prioritise built-in Neovim functionality

We have designed lilvim to demonstrate the capabilities of vanilla Neovim and lower the platform's barrier to entry for new users. Our approach encourages users to enjoy the benefits of a lightweight environment by first embracing the platform, then supplementing with plugins as needed.

## Related

There are plenty of projects that provide a framework of abstractions to simplify the learning curve of using Neovim over something like VSCode. Check out [LunarVim](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim) or [AstroVim](https://github.com/kabinspace/AstroVim) if you want a great batteries-included Neovim configuration.
